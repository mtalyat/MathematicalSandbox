		Types

There are several supported data types in Mathematical Sandbox. They include: boolean, integer, double, double[], string and expression. Variables can hold any type of data.

 - boolean (bool)
A data type that represents True or False. When used as a number, it will be converted to 1 for True, or 0 for False.

 - integer (int32)
A data type that represents a whole number.
Examples: 5, 245, -63

 - double (double)
A data type that represents a number.
Examples: 1, -3.67, 3.14159

 - double[] (double[])
A data type that represents an array of numbers.
Examples: [2.0, 5.22, 53.6], [1, 3, 5]

 - string (string)
A data type that represents a string literal.
Examples: "name", "x", "string literal"

 - expression (SymbolicExpression)
A data type that represents an expression (mathematical function).
Examples: {2 * x ^ 2}, {1 / 2 * pi * r ^ 2}, {(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) ^ (1.0 / 2) }

		Variables

Declare/set variables by doing doing the following syntax:

variableName = object
